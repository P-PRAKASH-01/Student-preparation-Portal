# 🎯 PrepHub - Student Preparation Portal

### *Your Ultimate Internship & Job Preparation Companion*


---

---

## 🌟 Overview

PrepHub is a free, offline-first web application that helps students organize their internship and job preparation journey. Track multiple companies, analyze your skill gaps, take notes, and monitor your progress—all in one beautiful, intuitive interface.

### 1) Why it was created

- To give students a lightweight, privacy-first tool to manage internship/job preparation without requiring accounts or cloud storage.
- To provide an offline-capable, easy-to-use dashboard for tracking companies, required skills, and individual preparation progress.
- To help students identify skill gaps and prioritize learning resources so they can apply more confidently.

### 2) How it works (high level)

1. You add companies and list required skills for each role.
2. You enter the skills you already have in the Skill Gap section.
3. The app compares required skills vs. your skills and highlights gaps for each company.
4. The Dashboard aggregates stats (companies tracked, favorites, skills needed, overall readiness).
5. All data is saved locally in the browser (LocalStorage) and the app is usable offline thanks to a Service Worker.

### 3) Install & App Workflow

- No installation is required to use PrepHub — open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with a local server.
- For a more native-like experience, use the browser's "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" feature (PWA). The app will then run like a standalone app and work offline.

Typical workflow:
1. Open the app and click "Get Started".
2. Add your current skills via the Skill Gap → Update Your Skills form.
3. Add companies you want to track (company name, role, required skills, location, type, deadline).
4. Use the Dashboard and Progress views to prioritize learning and applications.
5. Click the Settings button to view storage info or export data (export feature planned).

### 4) Stakeholders

- Students and interns — primary users who need to track preparation for internships and jobs.
- Career services / counselors — can recommend the tool to students for planning preparation tasks.
- Open-source contributors — developers who want to extend features (export, cloud sync, analytics).

### 5) What features are included

- Smart Dashboard with key stats and favorites
- Company management (add, edit, favorite, notes)
- Automated skill gap analysis and readiness percentage
- Progress tracking with per-company progress bars
- Local data persistence (LocalStorage) and Service Worker for offline use
- Modal forms for adding companies and updating skills
- Settings modal with storage information and install prompt support


### 6) Version 1.2 is Came 🔥✌️
